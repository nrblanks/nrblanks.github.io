		You said you didn’t want to date me. This isn’t supposed to be a “you can’t fire me because I quit” type of response, but I don’t want to date you either. When you meet someone under the conditions that we did, I imagine it’s not uncommon to have a certain bias as to what your mindset should be.

<p>
		I had a good time etc etc etc, I liked you etc etc etc, my head got caught up in a sharknado of crazy etc etc etc, and it became this one man head game where I felt the only next step was the “chase” and succeeding at that and going out again on a date was either going to happen or I was going to drive my convertible into a manure truck going after marty mcfly on a just invented skateboard.

		The important thing I want to say is I like you. I don’t want that to mean "I like you like you". I want it to mean I would like to know you more, to get motivation from you to do things I don’t normally do (like make a 7th grader quality website), to make you choose tea over coffee one time. 
</p>

<p>

		It doesn’t make sense to me to like you and not ever talk to you because I tried going a certain course and failed. It makes more sense to me to ask you to be a friend. That’s friend without any sort of prefix. That’s friend where I spend way too much time trying to figure out how this web design stuff works because I want you to like it. That’s friend where we get midweek beers and next round is on you.
